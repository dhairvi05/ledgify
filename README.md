<h1 align="center">🌀 Ledgify - Distributed Systems and GenAI Compliance Pipeline</h1>

A distributed, edge-native financial fraud monitoring pipeline that **ingests high-throughput transactions in real-time** and provides an **asynchronous, air-gapped forensic audit trail using localized GenAI**.

This project blends **high-performance backend infrastructure, advanced database design, and local retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to secure financial transactions against real-time threats.

## ✨ Features

* **High-Throughput Ingestion & Queuing**
  * Captures incoming transaction payloads instantly via Redis Streams using Consumer Groups
  * Decouples the primary API ingestion layer to maintain sub-second response times and prevent choking during traffic spikes

* **Polyglot Persistence Ledgering**
  * Enforces strict ACID compliance by committing transactional data to PostgreSQL
  * Uses database row-level locking to completely mitigate double-spending and race conditions
  * Offloads bloated metadata, system logs, and full JSON audit profiles into MongoDB for cold, scalable historical archiving

* **In-Memory Contextual RAG & Air-Gapped AI Auditing**
  * Queries historical transaction velocity profiles from PostgreSQL to build active user baselines on the fly
  * Injects specific user behavior metrics directly into a localized Ollama (Llama3) LLM context window
  * Generates instant forensic risk evaluation reports (Risk Rating, Threat Typology, Narrative Rationale) entirely within internal system memory—ensuring sensitive financial data never leaves localhost

## 📌 Project Workflow

1. **Ingest:** Transaction payloads are written directly to the primary Redis Stream topic.
2. **Route:** Ingestion workers consume messages, committing entries below a $5,000 threshold straight to PostgreSQL as `SETTLED`.
3. **Flag:** Transactions exceeding threshold limits or failing geographical velocity rules are marked as `FLAGGED` and cloned onto a secondary compliance stream.
4. **Retrieve (RAG):** The AI worker fetches the user's last 10 transactions from PostgreSQL to build a localized context baseline.
5. **Audit:** The context window is fed to a local Ollama model to generate structured forensic audit profiles.
6. **Archive:** The final combined JSON analysis is permanently persisted in MongoDB and updated in real-time on the monitoring interface.
